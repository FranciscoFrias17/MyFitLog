# MyFitLog

# Description

(WIP)
Have you ever been to the gym and see people walking around with notepads writing down their sets and weight values for each of their workouts? Well no more! With MyFitLog you can log all your important workout data right on your phone! MyFitLog is a full-stack mern app that allows the user to log their workouts for the day as well as track the amount of weight that they use for each workout set. This is all mananaged by having a user register and sign in to their account to keep track of their workouts. The front end is managed by React and Redux. The backend is a nodejs server managed by express. The database is a mongoDB cluster.
